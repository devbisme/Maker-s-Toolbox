These are the design files for the *Maker's Toolbox* postcard I handed out at the 2012 Open Hardware Summit.

* tables.ods is a LibreOffice Calc file containing the various tables of information for the card.
* Rdivider.py is a Python file that is used with the pynomo library to generate a resistor-divider nomogram.
* toolbox.svg is an Inkscape file that combines the tables, nomogram and other figures into the front and back sides
of a 4" x 6" postcard.
